	.SYNOPSIS
		Get-FlashPlayerUpdate is a Powershell module to check and install FlashPlayer updates.

	.DESCRIPTION
		FlashPlayer has been target of many attacks recently and historically. For anyone, it is very important to keep the FlashPlayer up-to-date. To start with there are 3 types of FlashPlayer on Windows and traditional process to to get them is bit long and painful. This module tries to ease up on that pain and take care of checking and updating idividual or all type of FlashPlayers. 

	.PARAMETER  Type
		There are 3 major types of FlashPlayers for Windows activex, plugin and pepper. This script provides additional [default] type all. As the name suggest 'all' checks/patches activex, plugin and pepper type of FlashPlayers.

	.PARAMETER  Patch
		Valid options for this parameter is yes, no. Default is yes. This parameter lets you check the version without patching the system.

	.PARAMETER  Logfile
		This is for future expansion of the module; where one can specify and logfile to redirect all the optput to that log file	

	.EXAMPLE
		PS C:\> Get-FlashPlayerUpdate -Type 'activex' -Patch 'no'
		Sample output:
		================================================================================
		Checking Flash Player version for activex architecture
		================================================================================
		Congratulations, your Flash Player (activex) [18.0.0.232] is up-to-date
		
		This example shows how to check Local as well as Latest versions of ActiveX type FlashPlayer (used in IE). The additional parameter -Patch 'no' instructs module that we just want to compair Local and Latest version without installing it.

	.EXAMPLE
		PS C:\> Get-FlashPlayerUpdate
		Sample output:
		================================================================================
		Checking Flash Player version for activex architecture
		================================================================================
		Congratulations, your Flash Player (activex) [18.0.0.232] is up-to-date
		================================================================================
		Checking Flash Player version for plugin architecture
		================================================================================
		No Plugin Flash Found
		Installing Flash for plugin
		You have successfully updated Flash Player for plugin [18.0.0.232]
		Total time taken[0 h:0 m:4 s]
		================================================================================
		Checking Flash Player version for pepper architecture
		================================================================================
		No Pepper Flash Found
		Installing Flash for pepper
		You have successfully updated Flash Player for pepper [18.0.0.232]
		Total time taken[0 h:0 m:5 s]
		
		This example takes advantage of default -Type parameter 'all'. In other words, this will go and check if there is an update avialble for activex, plugin or pepper type FlashPlayer; and if yes it will download it from Adobe and install it.
